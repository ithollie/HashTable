Religions have been around for ages.  Some religions have survived the times and some have not. Because of the strict beliefs of some religions, they find it difficult to continue.  In John 14:6,  it is noted "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me". As I proceed, I will state what  Christianity belief and why exclusivism is okay.

    Christianity belief that to have a relationship with God you have to go through Jesus.  This approach doesn't rest well with non-Christians due to its strict demand to have a relationship with God through Jesus. Religion should have exclusivism to maintain its structure and belives if it wants to survive. After interacting with these statements,   I can answer someone accusing Christianity of exclusivism that it is okay for Christianity to be exclusive on how someone attains a relationship with God. 

    In conclusion, It is noted " I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me". In my point of view, it is okay for Christianity to be exclusive in how an individual attains a  relationship with God. Exclusivism is what makes Christianity different from other religions.
